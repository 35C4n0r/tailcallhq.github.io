# About

If you landed here while searching for the literal meaning of a "tail call," here's a quick explanation: A tail call in programming is when a function's last action is to call another function. It's a key concept in functional programming, helping to optimize memory use, and is something we are passionate about at Tailcall. Welcome to the geek side, we've got puns! 🚀

**Now a little bit about us:**

At our core, we're not just a tech company; we're an adventurous troupe, riding the waves of tech innovation. 🏄‍♀️ Our pride and joy?

We create a culture that champions flexibility, 'higher-order' thinking, and a performance obsession that'd make a Formula 1 pit crew look laid-back!

But even the most exciting journey is better with companions, right? We're scouting for fellow tech enthusiasts who aren't afraid to confront functional programming's quirks, and share our passion for creating out-of-this-world solutions. 🌌 If you're all about solving complex problems, love flexibility in your work, and want to be part of a team that enjoys the journey as much as the destination, then you're our kind of person! 🚀

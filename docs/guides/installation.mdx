## Homebrew

1. If you don't already have Homebrew installed, you can find the instructions [here](https://brew.sh/).

2. Add the Tailcall repository to Homebrew by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```shell
   brew tap tailcallhq/tailcall
   brew install tailcall
   ```
3. Verify that Tailcall is installed correctly by running:
   ```shell
   tc
   ```
4. To start the Tailcall server, execute the following command:

   ```shell
   tc-server
   ```

   This will initiate the server at `http://localhost:8080/graphql`.

5. Once installation is done, **upgrades** can be performed via:

   ```bash
   brew update
   brew upgrade tailcall
   ```

## Curl

Follow the steps below to manually install the cli on your system:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tailcallhq/tailcall/main/install.sh | bash -s -- {versionData.tag_name}
```

This command fetches and executes the Tailcall installation script. The installed files are located in the `~/.tailcall` directory.

Upon completion of the installation, extend your `PATH` environment variable to include the `~/.tailcall/bin` directory:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/.tailcall/bin
```

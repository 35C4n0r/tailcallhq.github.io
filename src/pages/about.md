## About

If you landed here while searching for the literal meaning of a "tail call," here's a quick explanation: A tail call in programming is when a function's last action is to call another function. It's a key concept in functional programming, helping to optimize performance by not allocating anything from the caller's stack. Welcome to the geek side, we've got puns! 🚀

**PS:** If you were looking for the technical meaning of tailcall then the following might be a good starting point -

From _[Wikipedia]_

> In computer science, a tail call is a subroutine call performed as the final action of a procedure.

The basic idea is that it's a function call that is made at a place where no stack allocations are required. This happens when the caller of the function is simply returning the result of the called function. This optimization doesn't have any performance impact however it gives us the flexibility to design and implement mutually recursive functions.
